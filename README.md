# JavaScript-Calculator
A simple graphical calculator created with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

# Description
A mimic of a simple desk calculator that comes with standard functions. 
HTML and CSS providing the graphic and JavaScript providing the logic and refreshing of the screen.

# Instructions
The mouse or the keyboard can be used to interact with the calculator.
The two enter keys on the keyboard serve as "equals" buttons and "Del" key serves as "AC" or all-clear button.

# Installation/Run
Calculator can be run from https://eugene-l-h.github.io/JavaScript-Calculator/ or by downloading the files
and opening the index.html file in the browser of your choice. This project was developed and tested in Google Chrome.

# Notes
This project taught me a very valuable lesson in the importance of organization and planning ahead.
I ran into many bugs, unexpected behaviour, and challenges regarding the increasing complexity of my code.

I am also not entirely happy with the readability of my work and the organization of it which I believe 
links directly to my lack of planning ahead at the beginning of the project. 

Switch statements look messy.

I will be spending more time and energy in the planning stage on projects to
come.

*I did make an attempt at rewriting all of the JavaScript code using a, I feel,
cleaner more OOP approach. It can be viewed as the 'refactored' branch.*
