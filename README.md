# Notes
This project taught me a very valuable lesson in the importance organization and planning ahead.
I ran into many bugs, unexpected behavior, and challenges regarding the increasing complexity of my code.

I am also not entirely happy with the readability of my code and the organization of it which I believe 
links directly to my lack of planning ahead at the beginning of the project. Switch statements look messy.

I will be spending more time and energy in the planning stage on projects to come.
